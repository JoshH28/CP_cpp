# [Intro]
# Mm-mm, mm mm

# [Verse 1]
# Think back to all the times we were young and clueless
# Those memories just seem so faded and useless

# [Pre-Chorus]
# Can you and me be like we used to be then?
# Thinking 'bout if we could just get back together

# [Chorus]
# Can we go back to the times that we would sit down and sing out loud?
# Shouting all the songs we heard on the radio
# Take me back to the times when we were young
# Laughing and sitting underneath thе sun
# Can you take me back to the timеs we used to love?

# [Drop]
# We used to love, love
# We used to love, love
# We used to love, love
# We used to love
# We used to love, love
# We used to love, love
# We used to love, love
# We used to love

# [Post-Drop]
# Take me back to the times when we were young
# Laughing and sitting underneath the sun
# Can you take me back to the times we used to love?
# We used to love

# [Verse 2]
# I didn't mean to hurt you by leaving, you know
# I Just needed to find my own heart

# [Pre-Chorus]
# Can you and me be like we used to be then?
# Thinking 'bout if we could just get back together

# [Chorus]
# Can we go back to the times that we would sit down and sing out loud?
# Shouting all the songs we heard on the radio
# Take me back to the times when we were young
# Laughing and sitting underneath the sun
# Can you take me back to the times we used to love?

# [Drop]
# We used to love, love
# We used to love, love
# We used to love, love
# We used to love
# We used to love, love
# We used to love, love
# We used to love, love
# We used to love
# [Outro]
# Take me back to the times when we were young
# Laughing and sitting underneath the sun
# Can you take me back to the times we used to love?
# We used to love
